                    Cous Cous is A traditional Berber dish of semolina 
                    (granules of durum wheat) which is cooked by steaming. 
                    Usually Couscous also has meat, many vegetables, and a very 
                    strong sauce. CousCous is eaten in a way where you can only 
                    eat what is in front of you, it is one big bowl that a family 
                    shares, you don't use plates and you usually eat it with your hands.

      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Gather the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Mix the meat, onion, tomatoes, oil, and spices in the bottom of a 
        couscoussier. Cook <br>uncovered over medium to medium-high heat, 
        stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until the meat is 
        browned and the onions and tomatoes have formed a thick sauce.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">Add the water, the parsley/cilantro bouquet, and the chickpeas, if using. 
        Cover, and bring to a boil<br> over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, 
        and simmer rapidly for 25 to 30 minutes. (If omitting both meat and 
        chickpeas, simmer for just a few minutes.)

      <li class="list-group-item container">
        First Steaming of Couscous
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        While the meat is cooking, get the couscous ready for its first steaming. 
        Oil the steamer basket and<br> set it aside. Empty the dry couscous into a
         very large bowl, and work in the vegetable oil with your hands, tossing 
         the couscous and rubbing it between your palms. (This will help prevent 
         the couscous grains from clumping together.)
        </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Work in 1 cup of water in the same manner, using your hands to evenly 
        distribute the liquid into the couscous. Transfer the couscous to the 
        oiled steamer<br> basket.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Add the cabbage to the meat mixture, and place the steamer basket on top 
        (seal the joint if necessary). Once you see steam rising from the couscous, 
        steam the<br> couscous for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Pour the couscous back into the large bowl and break it apart.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        When the couscous has cooled enough to handle, gradually work in 2 cups of 
        water and 1 tablespoon of salt with your hands. Again, toss the couscous 
        and rub<br> it between your palms to break up any balls or clumps. 
        Transfer the couscous back into the steamer, taking care not to pack or 
        compress the couscous.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Second Steaming of Couscous.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Gather the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Add the turnips, carrots, tomatoes, onions, and fava 
        beans (if using) to the pot. Place the steamer basket on top 
        of the couscoussier (seal the joint if necessary), and steam 
        the couscous a second time for 15 minutes, timing 
        from when<br> you see the steam rising from the couscous.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Once the couscous has steamed for 15 to 20 minutes, turn it out into 
        the large bowl again. Break it apart, and let cool a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        If you're serving the couscous with jalapeño peppers, 
        simmer the peppers, covered, in a half-ladle of broth and a 
        little water, for about 40 minutes, or until the jalapeños 
        are tender. (The peppers are typically placed on top<br> of 
        the couscous, and small pieces may be broken off as a condiment.)
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Third Steaming of Couscous</li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Gradually work 3 cups of water into the couscous with your hands, 
        tossing it and rubbing the grains between your palms. Taste the couscous, 
        and add a little salt if desired.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Transfer about half of the couscous to the steamer basket. Again, try to 
        handle the couscous lightly and avoid packing it into the steamer.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Add the squash, zucchini, and sweet potatoes, if using, to the couscoussier
        , and place the steamer basket on top. (Again, seal the joint if necessary.)
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        When you see the steam rise through the couscous, carefully add the 
        remaining couscous to the steamer. Continue cooking, watching for the 
        steam to rise from the couscous. Allow the couscous to steam for a
         full 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, all of the vegetables should 
         be cooked.<br> Test the vegetables to be sure, cooking longer if 
         necessary. Taste the broth—it should be salty and peppery—and adjust 
         the seasoning if desired.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Serving the Couscous and Vegetables.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        Empty the couscous into the large bowl, and break it apart. Mix in the 2 
        tablespoons of butter with 2 ladles of broth.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item container">
        To serve the couscous, shape it into a mound with a well in the center. 
        Put the meat into the well, and arrange the vegetables on top and all 
        around. Distribute the broth evenly over the couscous and vegetables, 
        reserving one or two bowlfuls to offer on the side for those who prefer 
        more.
