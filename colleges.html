          Video game developers make and design games, that is why I want to become one,
          I have always been interested in game design, but I did not have alot of knowlage
          on were to start learning, luckily I can realy start now that I am in high school
          and can hopfully continue in college. That is why all my colleges have very good
          Game Design Programs.

            "Drexel Westphal’s Game Design & Production major, recognized by The 
            Princeton Review as one of the top undergraduate game design programs 
            in the country, combines a strong comprehension of animation and 
            interactivity, along with an understanding of design and programming. 
            The Bachelor of Science in Game Design & Production, housed in the 
            Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, mirrors a sector that has 
            seen an explosion not just in consumer gaming, but also throughout the 
            corporate enterprise world. The gaming industry has grown from just a 
            source of entertainment to one that also encompasses the use of serious 
            gaming, where gaming technologies are used in education and training. 
            Fully immersive games now use new methods of interaction, such as 
            multi-touch displays, motion control and haptic devices. The BS in Game 
            Design & Production at Drexel University is designed to evolve with the 
            dynamic gaming industry, introducing students to the latest technologies, 
            innovations, and trends."(Drexel Univeristy)

            "The Master of Science in Computer Science (Game Development) 
            program graduates students with a strong foundation in computer 
            science, an engineering-oriented game development core, and a focus 
            in key areas of game development, such as infrastructure, cognition 
            and games, immersion, serious games, etc. Immediately upon graduation, 
            students will be capable of engineering next generation games and 
            simulations and their required technologies for the entertainment and 
            serious game industry. Additionally, graduates from this program will 
            be able to further their education in graduate programs in game 
            development and computer science.  A long term goal of this M.S. 
            degree is to establish research and development directions that create 
            a science of games and an accompanying literature archive that improves 
            game development for both serious and entertainment purposes."(USC Viterbi)

            "A computer science degree offers a foundation that empowers graduates 
            to adapt to new technologies and new ideas. It spans a range of 
            knowledge — from theory to programming to cutting-edge development of 
            computing solutions. Students with a computer science degree are not 
            only prepared in the application of fundamental computing principles and 
            software development skills, but also become adept at teamwork, 
            effective communication, professionalism, ethics and the engagement 
            of learning and applying new ideas and technologies as the field 
            evolves."(Michigan State University)
